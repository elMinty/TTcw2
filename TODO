3 different corpus -> corpora

OT, NT, Quran

each has documents (verses) belonging

for each corpus/class ->> want to know how many documents it contains

for each term -> know how many documents it belongs to (1 if contained, 0 if not scores for each document that contains term)
              -> also has class example for term 'jesus' , 'OT' : 0, 'NT': 133, 'Q': 3 (not accurate)



FOR EACH CORPORA ; get NO of documents, return term index:

containing ->

1. amount of documents contained
2.


@TODO after 24th

- Done: indexes of both corpora and doc_map
- DO: load these in, change dictionary to have word term to class and then list

have dictionary -> word -> ['OT','NT','Quran'] -> number of documents within class that contain word
